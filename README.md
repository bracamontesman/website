This Git repository houses my personal website. Its purpose is to store and archive the various versions through which the website evolves.
The **Git log** has been reset five times, indicating that the current **Init v7** is a consolidation of approximately 120 commits predating all those recorded in the current history. Unfortunately, only the last nine commits are preserved in a Private Archive repository.

This website went live in February 2024.
